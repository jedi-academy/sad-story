Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill was able to catch the pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack continued to tumble down the hill.

Fortunately, the Flash saved Jack from falling over the hill’s edge.

Unfortunately, Jill started screaming at the Flash who ran away and let Jack die.

Fortunately, a thousand screaming snakes descended upon jack and catapulted him into the sun.

Unfortunately, the pail of water disintregated through the heat of the sun.

Fortunately, the jedis learned how to airbend.

Unfortunately, the Dragonsnakes attacked.

Fortunately, the storyline was so silly that no one believed that the Dragonsnakes
existed, so they vanished.

Unfortunately, Jack was still gone and so was the water.

Fortunately, a wizard reversed time and the pail was remade full of water.

Unforunately, Jill didn't catch the new pail.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
