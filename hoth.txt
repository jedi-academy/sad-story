Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill has cat-like reflexes and saves Jack from falling.

Unfortunately, a cat came out of nowhere and attacked Jack.

Fortunately, Jack overpowerd the cat.

Unfortunately, the cat leaved a mark on Jack's hand.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
