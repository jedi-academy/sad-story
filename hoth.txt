Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, he was agile and was able to keep his balance.

Unfortunately, there was a pile of cow dung and he stepped on it.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
