Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill saw Jack tumble and tried to catch him with her elastic arms.

Unfortunately, Jack bounded off of Jill's elastic arms and got flung into the air. 

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
