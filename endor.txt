Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jack is well trained in martial arts and does a flip.

Unfortunately, Jack fails the flip and lands on his face.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
