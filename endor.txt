Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack fell down and broke his crown.

Fortunately, the ground was very mushy and Jack did not get injured.

Unfortunately, the mushy ground was actually a monster.

Fortunately, the monster is is a cookie monster and offered him cookies.

Unfortunately, the cookies are disgusting.

Fortunately, Jill came tubelling down but dinot get hurt.

Unfortunately, Jack broke his right arm.

Fortunately, Jill noticed and yelled out for help.

Unfortunately, Jill had sore throat.

Fortunately, Mark the doctor was there to cure Jill.

Unfortunately, Jill triped on his way.

Fortunately, Jill didnt get hurt.

Unfortunately, Jack didn’t hear her in time.

Fortunately, a group of Ewoks came up to Jack to fix his arm.

Unfortunately, they started to eat him.

Fortunately, the Ewoks did not know that Jill injected Jack with poison so they were all poisoned and died.

Unfortunately, THAT'S WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. 
But when the world needed him the most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and Katarra and Sokka discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang.  
And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.

Fortunately, Jim and Pope used their Jedi powers and saved the world before anything could happen.

Unfortunately, Jill was a Sith lord and the darkside ruled the world forever.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
