Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.

Unfortunately, the village had a dark secret and the water was use as a catalyst in a ritual to sacrifice Jill to the devil.

Fortunately, Jack was a double agent and had anticipated this.
