Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, aliens invaded and distored gravity so that for the few seconds which Jack tripped gravity was reversed and jack did not fall.

Unfortunately, the brief period of reversed gravity caused Jill to be thrown upwards into space. 

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
