Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jack was a sorcerer and teleported himself back upright as well as his pail of water.
Unfortunately, Jack was seen by a Imeperial Inquistory who called him a heretic that needed purging.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
