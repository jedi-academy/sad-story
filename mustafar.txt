Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill caught him with her quick reactions.

Unfortunately, when Jack reached the top of the hill, there was a raging mustafarian waiting for him.

Fortunately, Jack was a psychic and used the warp to crush the raging mustafarian.

Unfortunately, Jack was seen by a Imperial Inquistor who called him a heretic that needed purging.

Fortunately, the Imperial Inquisitor swiftly slew Jack for his heresy.

Unfortunately, there was still a lot of rebel scum out in the galaxy.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
