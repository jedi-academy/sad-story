Jack and Jill were brother and sister living in a small village.

One day, Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.


Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root. Jack fell down and broke the crown of his head. 
Jill, who was walking past Jack also trembled, As she placed the bucket of water, she fell and tumbled down the hill after him. 

Jack was hurt but jill was alright. 

She got up and asked a villager who was passing by to help her and her brother. 
He was kind and helped Jill with his hurt and carefully took the bucket of water to their home.


Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
