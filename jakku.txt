Jack and Jill were brother and sister living in a small village. One day, Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root. Jack fell down and broke the crown of his head. Jill also trembled with heavy bucket and fell.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved as a villager helped them.
