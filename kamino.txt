Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill is actually a jedi and she used Force Levitate to save Jack.

Unfortunately, Jill is still a trainee and used too much power and sent Jack to the stratosphere.

Fortunately, Jack found a place to land.

Unfortunately, Jack landed on the Death Star.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
