Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, they see each otherâ€™s eyes and they forgave each other.

Unfortunately, Jack and Jill suddenly fight each other.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
