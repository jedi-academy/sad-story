Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

Fortunately, Jill is actually a jedi and she used Force Levitate to save Jack.

Unfortunately, Jill is still a trainee and used too much power and sent Jack to the stratosphere.

Fortunately, Scooby Doo heard the kafuffle and came running.

Unfortunately, he slobbered so much that Jill slipped and fell on her butt.

Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.
